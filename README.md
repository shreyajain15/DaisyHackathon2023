### Your virtual pricing assistant

Created a robust solution using Machine Learning to help small retail businesses manage their prices amongst their competitors to make maximum profits. 

The program takes in the retial competitors online flyers and then recognizes the price difference amongst them by using image recognition, and then compares the product prices to the small retailer's inventory, telling them to either drop or raise their prices. 

- Pretrained OCR model that detects text in image
- Text processed and filtered to find both the price and the product name
- Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm to understand which item on the flyer maps best to the one in our inventory

Overall, our solution is a  free pricing tool that reads through flyers to determine the going price of products sold by competitors!
